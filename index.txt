Aashutosh Chapagain - Section 03 - Dr. Eloe / 10 am MWF

I am an international student, coming from Nepal. I am a junior here and Computer Science Major. I am very much into sports and music. I love being creative and learning new things. Being highly involved in music in high school, its a mystery why I chose Computer Science as my major in college.

I guess I came to choose Computer Science as my major as I wanted to use my creativity and be a developer. So far, I plan on being a front end developer. I dont have a huge experience yet but i have worked on some small projects and I loved it so far. Proabably thats the reason Im still going strong in Computer Science.
